# 🚀 Railway Deployment Files Created

Your ChatPDF backend is now ready for Railway deployment! Here's what I've prepared for you:

## 📁 New Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for optimal Railway deployment
- `Procfile` - Process definition (updated for Railway)
- `requirements.txt` - Updated with all backend dependencies

### Documentation & Scripts
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete step-by-step deployment guide
- `setup-railway-env.sh` - Interactive script to set environment variables
- `verify-deployment.sh` - Script to test your deployed backend

## 🔧 Backend Updates Made

1. **CORS Configuration**: Updated to handle Railway domains
2. **Environment Detection**: Better production environment handling
3. **MongoDB Connection**: Ready for Railway's MongoDB service
4. **Dependencies**: All required packages included in requirements.txt

## 🚀 Quick Start Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Add MongoDB service: "New Service" → "Database" → "MongoDB"
6. Set environment variables (see below)

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Add MongoDB
railway add mongodb

# Set environment variables
./setup-railway-env.sh
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables Required

Copy these to your Railway project's Variables tab:
```
ENVIRONMENT=production
DB_NAME=chatpdf_database
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production-chatpdf-2024

# ... add more as needed
```

## ✅ After Deployment

1. **Test your deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./verify-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Get your Railway URL**:
   - Check Railway dashboard, or
   - Run: `railway domain`

3. **Update your frontend**:
   - Set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to your Railway URL
   - Deploy frontend to Netlify/Vercel
